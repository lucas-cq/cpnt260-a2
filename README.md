### Code Review
My biggest problem during this assignment was making my grid layout responsive. I tried moving around my code, but the page
was still static. After taking a step back and collecting myself I had an idea. I realized I had my cards specified to a specific column. Whew. I almost jumped ship and went back to flex box, but I held on and learned something new. Now my cards fall beneath each other when you minimize the screen. My only problem now is a margin error when minimized, but its not that big. I think I can fix this in the future with an @media tag. Overall I learned some grid, made it look pretty, and had some fun with the process. Maybe FlexBox isn't so bad after all.
